====================================

**MeTTa (Meta Type Talk): A Language for Programming with Knowledge**

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the MeTTa Standard Library!

MeTTa is a cutting-edge, **multi-paradigm programming language** specifically designed for the exciting frontier of **declarative and functional computations over knowledge metagraphs**.  It moves beyond traditional programming paradigms, offering a uniquely powerful and flexible environment for building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems and advanced knowledge-based applications.

At its heart, MeTTa embraces a **symbolic approach to AI**, allowing you to represent knowledge, relationships, and reasoning processes in a natural and intuitive way.  Unlike languages focused solely on data or algorithms, MeTTa empowers you to **program with meaning**, directly manipulating abstract concepts and complex relationships within its knowledge metagraph, the **AtomSpace**.
